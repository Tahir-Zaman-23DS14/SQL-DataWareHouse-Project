# Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple sources, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications

- **Data Sources**  
  Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

- **Data Quality**  
  Clean and resolve data quality issues before performing analysis.

- **Integration**  
  Combine data from both sources into a single, user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries.

- **Scope**  
  Focus only on the latest available dataset. Data historization is not required.

- **Documentation**  
  Provide clear documentation of the data model to support business stakeholders and analytics teams.
